Hello, my name is brunswick2, and i am here today to talk about the theoretical situation when someone makes a discord grabber specifically for guilded,

Guilded uses a different API system then discord, and alot of discord grabbers uses discord webhooks, because of this people can stop the scam by sending messages through it and deleting it.

What if someone makes a grabber specifically for guilded and spreads the rat through discord?

Alot of people have discord webhook spammers, that not made for guilded, so the rat would be unstoppable because of the spammers not supporting the guilded API system

even if there is a spammer made for guilded, guilded webhooks cant say @everyone, and if they use a bot for the grabber, you cant even sign into it to stop the scam, because there is no app to, the DiscordBotClient only supports discord bot tokens.

Alot of known grabbers use discord bots, (pysilon) (discordbotstealer) etc.

so if guilded grabbers use a bot token, they are 10 times more safer then a webhook because its impossible to nuke the scam.


Thank you for reading this, if you have any information that i left out or isnt true, please add brunswick2 on discord, thank you.
